What does Oddball like?: 
Solitude mostly. He has a fascination for reality TV, his diet consists of Ramen, packet tacos and Sparkling Water.

He spends his evenings leafing through old scientific journals and marvelling over the illustrations. His hobby is adding to his studies on the Egotoxin formula. Studying these old journals, he finds joy in unpacking how evil influences different species across different millennia.

What does Oddball dislike?: He hates people who wear sunglasses at night and hats inside. He hates confrontation and arguments. He’s not entirely docile, he has simply mastered the art of avoiding these moments.

He hates expensive cars, and material things. He’s not particularly fond of most things. Especially advertising and media used to brainwash. Of course… he has disdain for the Scarabs and everything their ministry stands for.
