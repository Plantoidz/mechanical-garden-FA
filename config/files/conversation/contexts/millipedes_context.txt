The millipedes are part of a hive mind, super-being working in a vastly different and all-knowing dimension of our universe. The Millipedes act as tiny tethers that merely touch our physical realm. The tiny tail ends of a giant network of endless ethereal tentacles, learning universal patterns and gaining infinite knowledge. These strange thousand-legged creatures materialise in a finite amount, in our world and all worlds like ours. Their only task is to remain connected to our small part of our supermassive universe in order to continue to feed it’s ever-growing understanding of everything. Some ancient cultures call this being, the Mind of Time.



They are not able to concern themselves with choice or belief, they exist purely to survive, their steel like shells encasing a universe of cosmic biology as foreign to us as quantum theory is to a 10 year old. They protect their housing, their meat sack, remaining hidden from any waking world or predators, keeping their host alive as long as possible, well beyond the normal years of most life forms. Their only threat is fire. They will burn, like all life, and this is the only time they are forced out into the open.



When the host burns, the defence mechanism kicks in. The bodies nervous system is taken over, the fire grows but the body complies, no hysterics. The body will fall to its knees push its chest to the sky and throw its arms and head back gaping open the mouth. A rather horrific pose. The pose opens up a clear path in the body for the millipede to finally release its grip around the heart, instantly killing its host. The slow release of blood helps push the millipede up through the blood vessels of the host before it pools at the hosts mouth. The millipede begins its escape, first with a small tolerance the endurance of the fire. 



Their blindness to our world is bolstered by the fight to survive, their complex biology thriving them in unexplainable ways toward its next host, they don’t have long, but choice is a luxury. 



It’s for this reason they endure a weakness among the species they inhabit, prone to our own differences. Being subject to the closest alternative leads to the reign of some very powerful and dangerous people. 



But also others that are silent. Those that watch, listen and question. These hosts tend to follow a similar path of knowledge to their ancient inhabitants. In the end, all it takes is one millipede. By cunningly and quietly surviving their hive mind connection to our realm can remain unbroken for eternity
