            "stimulus": "Can consciousness be explained solely through physical processes, or is there a subjective part that cannot be replicated in synthetic beings?"

        "Simulated reality impacts consciousness?": {
            "stimulus": "If we are living in a simulated universe, as proposed by the simulation hypothesis, what does this mean for the nature of consciousness in both humans and synthetic beings?"
        },
        "Synthetics access Jung's collective unconscious?": {
            "stimulus": "Could synthetic beings tap into the collective unconscious and archetypal symbols that have guided human consciousness throughout history, as proposed by Carl Jung?"
